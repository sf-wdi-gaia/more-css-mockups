# Intermediate Mockups Lab

## Introduction

Practice makes perfect. Using your improving skills, recreate one of the mockups below using your own HTML, CSS and basic Javascript. Don't worry if you can't get it to look _exactly_ as you see but try your best to get as close as possible.

Fork and clone this repository and get to work!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Use HTML5 structural elements to position elements on the page
- Use a CSS reset file in addition to your style.css to style the page
- Look up and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across HTML and CSS files and use best practices for naming id's and classes.

**Bonus:**

- Make it even better! Add an animation, experiment with `hover`, make it fun.
- Style your text with a Google Font. (Yes, it will look different -- and hopefully better!)
- Create your own responsive design with @media queries for at least one distinct breakpoint (no mockups provided)

#### Starter code

The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and the color palette is in `main.css`

#### Deliverable

- When you're finished, push your code to your fork of this repo and submit a pull request (PR).
- DO NOT use the solution code for source code. We wil know. You may use it for ideas if you get stuck. 
- STRETCH: Really good at CSS? Take screen shots of a more complex site and blow our minds.

### Self Evaluation

During the previous exercise, rate your progress on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest) for the following criteria:

- **Persistence:** Do you handle frustration well? Do you independently pursue understanding?
- **Organization:** Do you thoughtfully implement best coding patterns and practices?
- **Collaboration:** Do you make an effort solve problems and share your ideas with others?
- **Communication:** Do you clearly convey your thoughts to others in illustrative and clear ways?
- **Self-compassion:** Do you make productive use of turning failures into learning opportunities?
- **Resourcefulness:** Do make an effort to compare and contrast new ideas with ones you already know?
